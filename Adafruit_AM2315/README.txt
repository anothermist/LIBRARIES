This is a library for the AM2315 Humidity + Temp sensor

Designed specifically to work with the AM2315 in the Adafruit shop 
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/1293

These sensors use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface

To download. click the ZIP button in the top-middle navbar, 
rename the uncompressed folder Adafruit_AM2315. 
Check that the Adafruit_AM2315 folder contains Adafruit_AM2315.cpp and Adafruit_AM2315.h

Place the Adafruit_AM2315 library folder your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder. 
You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.

To connect the AM2315 to the Arduino:

- RED wire goes to +5V
- BLACK wire goes to Ground
- WHITE wire goes to to i2c clock - on '168/'328 Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/etc that's Analog 5
- YELLOW wire goes to i2c data - on '168/'328 Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/etc that's Analog 4
