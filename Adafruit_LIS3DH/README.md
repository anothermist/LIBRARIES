This is the Adafruit LIS3DH breakout board library.
* https://www.adafruit.com/products/2809

This sensor communicates over I2C or SPI (our library code supports both) so you can share it with a bunch of other sensors on the same I2C bus.
There's an address selection pin so you can have two accelerometers share an I2C bus.

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!
