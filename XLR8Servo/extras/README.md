# XLR8Servo extras

This library also contains an example of using VHDL in Openxlr8
instead of Verilog. In the extras/rtl/ directory there are two
versions of the xlr8_servo module, one in Verilog and one in VHDL. To
select which gets used in the XB, simply edit the openxlr8.qsf file
and uncomment the line for the version you want. No other changes are
needed to code or settings!
