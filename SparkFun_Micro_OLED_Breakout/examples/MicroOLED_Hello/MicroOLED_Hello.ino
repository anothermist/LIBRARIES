  SFE_MicroOLED Hello World Demo

  Original Creation Date: October 26, 2014
  
  This sketch lights up a familiar pattern on the MicroOLED
  Breakout. It's a great way to prove you've connected everything
  correctly and that your display is in working order.
  
  Hardware Connections:
    We'll be using the SPI interface on the MicroOLED, though it
    also supports I2C (and a really messy parallel). If you want
    to swap in I2C, read through the comments to find out how.
    
    MicroOLED ------------- Arduino
      GND ------------------- GND
      VDD ------------------- 3.3V (VCC)
    D1/MOSI ----------------- D11 (don't change)
    D0/SCK ------------------ D13 (don't change)
      D2
      D/C ------------------- D8 (can be any digital pin)
      RST ------------------- D9 (can be any digital pin)
      CS  ------------------- D10 (can be any digital pin)
    
  Development environment specifics:
  	IDE: Arduino 1.0.5
  	Hardware Platform: MicroOLED Breakout
                           Arduino Pro 3.3V/8MHz
  
  Note: The display on the MicroOLED is a 1.8V-3.3V device only.
  Don't try to connect a 5V Arduino directly to it! Use level
  shifters in between the data signals if you have to resort to
  a 5V board.
  
  This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun 
  employee) at the local, and you've found our code helpful, 
  please buy us a round!

// Declare a MicroOLED object. The parameters include:
// 1 - Reset pin: Any digital pin
// 2 - D/C pin: Any digital pin (SPI mode only)
// 3 - CS pin: Any digital pin (SPI mode only, 10 recommended)

//MicroOLED oled(PIN_RESET, DC_JUMPER); //Example I2C declaration, uncomment if using I2C 

// I2C is great, but will result in a much slower update rate. The
// slower framerate may be a worthwhile tradeoff, if you need more
// pins, though.

  // Before you can start using the OLED, call begin() to init
  // all of the pins and configure the OLED.
  oled.begin();
  // clear(ALL) will clear out the OLED's graphic memory.
  // clear(PAGE) will clear the Arduino's display buffer.
